# FLINT JSON Editor
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

The `FLINT JSON Editor` is a platform-independent desktop app built on [`Electron`](https://www.electronjs.org/), [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) and [`Webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/). It is mainly used to create projects from pre-defined packages/set of JSON files. It can be used to create a CFG file by choosing a set of JSON files, or to open a project or set of JSON files either in a scratch based JSON editor or in a form-based editor. It is then used to power FLINT and its models.

## Key Features 

-   Users can choose a specific type of project and the application would create a set of JSON templates, which can then be easily edited by users. FLINT uses JSON files for a particular type of project like `Standard GCBM Project`, `GCBM + Peatland Project` and more, thus easing the process for users.
-   Users can choose the files for a project and choose to create a CFG file that points to the JSON files which are used for a particular project. It is aided by a `transfer-list` implementation where a CFG file can be created along with the corresponding JSON files. 
-   With the Open Project feature, Users won't need to select JSON files multiple times. We can now open a project which consists of multiple JSON files at one go and the users will also have the flexibility to remove JSON files from the dashboard before launching the editor.
-   A **ScratchJSONEditor** and **Form-like Editors** has been built from scratch to create/edit JSON files.
-   From a UI/UX perspective, a drag-and-drop feature has been added to drag a tab from one position to another.. The directory of the currently opened file is also shown at the title bar of the application.     

Have a look at the [Wiki Section](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-JSON-Interface/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code%2720-documentation-by-Abhishek-Garain) of the Project to get a deep dive into the whole project and understand it from a user perspective.
